# ðŸŒŒ SuperNova ðŸŒŒ
## Work In Progess  

SuperNova is a MITM attacking tool writen in python using [scapy](https://scapy.net/)
Also, he's the big Brother of [NOVA](https://github.com/b3rt1ng/NOVA) ;)

### Why is it better than Nova ?  
Nova was made using os calls to ping and get mac adresses for Linux.  
Basically SuperNova is building it's own requests based on the ICMP protocol, making it technically usable on every os as long as it support Scapy.  
SuoerNova's structure is designed to be easy to implement so you can mess with the code as you wish ;)
